# Note4AI

A minimalist, elegant note-taking Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with vanilla JavaScript and the TipTap editor.

## The Vision

As the author of Crawl4ai, I'm building a note-taking app for the age of AI. I'm tired of organizing, creating folders, and assigning tags. I dislike them all. No matter what, I always open my Apple Notes at the beginning, eager to create a structure. But by the end of the day, I end up putting all the notes into active notes on top for the entire year. When I move to the next year, I feel it's a bit lagging, and I start making new notes.

For those of you who feel the same way, you're going to love this.
